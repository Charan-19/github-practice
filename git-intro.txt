GIT: Global Information Tracker

It is a version control system(VCS) or source code management system(SCM).

What is GIT?
1. Git is used to track the files.
2. It will maintain multiple versions of the same file.
3. It is platform independent.
4. It is free and open-source.
5. They can handle larger projects efficiently.
6. They save time and developers can fetch and create pull requests without switching.
7. It is 3rd generation of version control system.
8. It is distributed version control system.

Roll back: going back to specific version.

Git tracks changes you made so you have a record of what has been done and you can revert to specific versions. It makes collaboration easy, allowing changes by multiple people to all merged into one source.

GIT Stages:

Working directory:
In this stage git is only aware of having files in the project.
It will not track these files until we commit those files.

To move files from working directory to staging area use below command
Command: git add

Staging area:
The staging area is like a rough draft space, it's where you can git add the version of a file or multiplr files that you want to save in your next commit.
In other words, in the next version of your project.

To move files from staging area to project folder use below command
Command: git commit

Repository:
Repository in git is considered as your project folder.
A repository has all the project-related data.
It contains the collection of the files and also history of changes made to those files.

Types of repositories:
Local repo: The local repository is everything in your .gitr directory. Mainly what you will see in your local repository are all of your commits. It is the area that save everything.

Remote repo: The remote repository is a git repository that is stored on some remote computer.

central repo: This will be present in our github.
